# My Master's thesis / Publication Nord J Bot

In this repository I host supporting information related to my MSc project __Ecological niche modeling of *Rumex hastatus* D. Don, a disjunctly distributed shrub of the Himalaya-Hengduan Mountains region__.

The resulting paper has been submitted to the __*Nordic Journal of Botany*__ under the title __The South Asian monsoon maintains the disjunction of *Rumex hastatus* between the Western Himalayas and the Hengduan Mountains, Southwest China__.
